I was asked to learn Ruby on Rails (RoR) for the PM app in EOX Vantage. It is a fork of OpenProject, which is an open source project management software for businesses.

I began initially by studying Ruby. Some resources I used were W3Schools, FreeCodeCamp, Tutorials Point. After a couple of days of doing this I jumped into learning RoR. FreeCodeCamp videos on youtube on this topic are really good and helpful. 
I then tried creating a simple webiste on my own using RoR to get the hang of it.(which is this Project itself)

I also forked and created a local copy of OpenProject to go through the code and to try out the application. Go through the OpenProject link attached below. The installation steps there are sufficient.
