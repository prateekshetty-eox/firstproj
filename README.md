# README

I was asked to learn Ruby on Rails (RoR) for the PM app in EOX Vantage. It is a fork of OpenProject, which is an open source project management software for businesses.

I began initially by studying Ruby. Some resources I used were W3Schools, FreeCodeCamp, Tutorials Point. After a couple of days of doing this I jumped into learning RoR. FreeCodeCamp videos on youtube on this topic are really good and helpful. 
I then tried creating a simple website on my own using RoR to get the hang of it.(which is this Project itself)

I also forked and created a local copy of OpenProject to go through the code and to try out the application. Go through the OpenProject link attached below. The installation steps there are sufficient.

To run this project, get a local copy on your system, cd into the project directory, type the "rails s" command in the terminal (assuming rails has already been installed on your system) and then open the localhost:3000 on your browser.

Go ahead and make changes according to your requirements and play around the application.
